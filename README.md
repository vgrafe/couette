# Get insights on your tests

- blazing AND fast
  - caches node_modules properly so you don't have to
  - caches test results for base branches
- smart logic to play well with github's 50 annotations limit
  - aggregates annotations when on the same LOC (still hard limit to 50 annotationa from github)
